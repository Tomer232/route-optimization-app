# ORP ‚Äì Optimal Route Planning

**Live deployment**: [https://clever-recreation-production.up.railway.app/](https://clever-recreation-production.up.railway.app/)

## üìå Project Overview

ORP enables users to plan multi-day off-road routes by selecting custom start, end, and intermediate points on an interactive map. The system dynamically calculates and displays an optimized walking route between the points. Users can test the system in guest mode or log in to save and revisit their routes.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Route Calculation

The routing algorithm is a customized implementation of **A\***, adapted to suit off-road walking scenarios. It evaluates nearby points based on elevation data retrieved from the Google Maps Elevation API. The system prioritizes paths that do not exceed a 30% incline, simulating realistic walking conditions across varying terrains.
